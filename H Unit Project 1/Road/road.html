        <td><tt>Somre roads are not well maintained. <br> There could be lots of cracks and holes and this is very dangerous
             because one could fall in and break bones.<br> Another problem is not with the road, but with the people.<br>
              People may drive too fast injuring others, or not pay attention to where they are going. Drunk driving and driving while using your phone are also hazards.
