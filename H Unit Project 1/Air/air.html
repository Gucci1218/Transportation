                <p><tt>Flight is so extremely important to us.<br> Traveling to distant places would be difficult to impossible without airways.
                <br>For instance, imagine driving for the US to India. By flight we can get their in a day, but by car this would take you months!</tt></p>
            </td>
            <td><tt>Sometimes the service is not great on airplanes.<br> Your bagage could get lost, and you may not be treated well.<br>
                For me specifically, it is the food.<br> The food is usually raw, dry, and packaged in a nasty container. <br>Flights are also expensive,
                and for a good, happy journey you need to pay even more! The bathrooms are also very unhygenic and long flights especially, are just not a great experience.
